Hi! I’m Tomas, a Finance Ph.D. student at Insper University, currently visiting MIT. I anticipate graduating in December 2025. I’m curious about:

- What drives assets returns?
  - In emerging markets?
  - In corporate bonds?
- How does financial development influence the real economy?

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked on projects of which I'm really proud. I launched [Brazil's largest high-school scholarship program](https://www.institutosomos.org/somos-futuro/) for low-income students, now present in over 120 cities across 21 states with over 750 students impacted. I spent 6 months in Rondonopolis, a small but important agricultural city in rural Mato Grosso, where I helped integrate CIE, a newly acquired school that I had previously evaluated. This experience allowed me to immerse myself in that region of my country. Just before starting my Ph.D., I fulfilled a personal dream by running my own bakery, which taught me valuable lessons in entrepeneurship and management.

## Current projects

### [Firm Characteristics and Stock Returns in Brazil](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4801117)

##### With Ruy Ribeiro, Josue Costa, Mohammed Kaebi and Igor Martins.

__Abstract:__ We investigate the impact of firm characteristics on stock returns in the Brazilian financial market, considering a long list of characteristics found be relevant in the U.S. market. Employing Fama-MacBeth regressions, alongside machine learning techniques, we examine over 24 firm-level characteristics. Our findings highlight the stronger influence of price-related metrics, such as momentum, liquidity, size and volatility, over accounting variables. We also explore the robustness of these characteristics through the construction of various portfolios, revealing significant alphas in multiple portfolio construction methods and substantial out-of-sample performance.

### Betting on Betas but against Duration
#### With Lira Mota and Luca Mertens
(Coming soon!)

### Development of Finance: Human Capital Perspective
#### With Jiageng Liu

In this project we are interested in the relationship between the development of the financial sector in Brazil and the development of the real economy. Particularly, we are looking at the employment dataset of RAIS and issuance information.
