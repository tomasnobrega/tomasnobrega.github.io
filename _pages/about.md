Hi! I’m Tomas, a Finance Ph.D. student at Insper University, currently visiting MIT. I’m curious about:

- What drives assets returns?
- How does financial development help the real economy?

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked on some project I'm really proud of. I launched [Brazil's largest high-school scholarship program](https://www.institutosomos.org/somos-futuro/), present in over 120 cities across 21 states. Another memorable experience was the 6 months I spent in Rondonopolis, a small but important agricultural city in rural Mato Grosso. I was there to help integrate a newly acquired school that I had valued, and it was an amazing opportunity to learn about that region of my country. And just before starting my Ph.D., I fulfilled a personal dream by running my own bakery.

# Current projects

## [Firm Characteristics and Stock Returns in Brazil](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4801117)
#### With Ruy Ribeiro, Josue Costa, Mohammed Kaebi and Igor Martins.
__Abstract:__ We investigate the impact of firm characteristics on stock returns in the Brazilian financial market, considering a long list of characteristics found be relevant in the U.S. market. Employing Fama-MacBeth regressions, alongside machine learning techniques, we examine over 24 firm-level characteristics. Our findings highlight the stronger influence of price-related metrics, such as momentum, liquidity, size and volatility, over accounting variables. We also explore the robustness of these characteristics through the construction of various portfolios, revealing significant alphas in multiple portfolio construction methods and substantial out-of-sample performance.
